# Mail Creator

This project was created to streamline the work of the Marketing team at the company where I work.

Every month, birthday emails are sent with the birthdays of the month separated by day.

Initially, this task was done manually by consulting an Excel spreadsheet with the data of all employees.

The project aims to simplify this process by receiving the Excel spreadsheet, separating the birthdays, and generating the PNG image to be attached to the emails.
